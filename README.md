This is a timeclock designed and writted by Zac Strickland for use at R&S Machining


To everyone from Reddit that gave me a hand with my first big project, I appreciate you.

So this thing will build a SQLite database, take the card number, run it against a database of card numbers and employees, spit out the name of the person and the current time, write the name and the current time and date to the next available row in a seperate table in the database, and has the ability to add and remove people from the Employee table.

Things I'm currently working on:

Admin-side frontend for things like:
  Seeing at a glance what the total weekly hours are for each individual
  Hex-based login for making edits to the Times table itself
