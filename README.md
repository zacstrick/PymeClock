# PymeClock
This is a timeclock designed by me for use at R&amp;S Machining


To whomever is currently looking at this, I appreciate you.

So I need this thing to take the card number, run it against the included csv, spit out the name of the person and the current time, write the current time to the next available cell in the row next to the name, calculate total hours worked this week and total hours worked today and also display that, and they'll eventually want to be able to see everyone that's currently clocked in as well.
